        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            I'm Claire Bennett, and I'm passionate about Computer Science with a specialized focus on Project
            Management. My journey has equipped me with a robust foundation in both quality engineering and software
            engineering, thanks to invaluable internship experiences.

            What truly distinguishes me is not merely my technical acumen, but my multifaceted perspective, shaped by my
            background in both quality and software engineering. I enthusiastically embrace challenges and thrive in
            collaborative environments. My commitment to education is evident through my role as an admin PT at Texas
            A&M, where I'm dedicated to supporting students in their computer science courses.

            My philosophy centers on the potential of teamwork and continuous growth. Beyond being a
            diligent worker, I embody the essence of a team player who champions open communication and fosters
            innovation.

        </p>

        <p class="p2">
            Outside of my academic pursuits, I cherish quality time with friends, cultivating meaningful connections. In
            addition to nurturing human bonds, I share my life with three delightful guinea pigs, who are part of my
            extended family. Interestingly, my closest friend also has two guinea pigs, and they have formed an adorable
            camaraderie, which never ceases to bring joy to our lives.

            Apart from my social and pet-related interests, I'm an avid enthusiast of the epic world of "Lord of the
            Rings." The rich storytelling and immersive fantasy realm have always held a special place in my heart.
            Additionally, I find solace and amusement in various cartoon shows, which provide a delightful escape into
            imaginative and entertaining worlds.

            These personal interests not only reflect my diverse passions but also contribute to my well-rounded
            perspective, fostering creativity and a sense of wonder that I bring to my academic and professional
            pursuits.
